# MDS-Project
Generative music library made by Sandu Daniel, Fierbinteanu David, Dumitrescu Marius, Budaca Razvan-Gabriel

## Project description
We designed and developed a Web Application where users can experiment with musical open-source AI models implemented by Google. A user can combine samples into a new one, continue a sample in the same style, check the newest samples or the top liked ones, play the samples or download them as MIDI files

  - Every sample should have a clickable like button, on Discovery or Top page
  - Likes will be counted behind the scenes 
- As a User I want to be able to see the most voted samples to see what generative music can do best
  - Users can access the Top page from our dashboard
  - This page will contain the most voted samples from our database 
- As a User I want to be able to combine 2 samples uploaded by someone else using generative music AIs
  - Users can access the Music Generation page from our dashboard
  - Between Combine and Continue, choose Combine
  - They can choose 2 different samples from drop-down menus (?) and click Combine
  - The resulting sample is a combination of the chosen ones
- As a User I want to be able to continue an existing sample using generative music AIs
  - From the Music Generation page, choose to Continue sample
  - After selecting a sample, click Continue
  - The resulting sample is a continuation of the selected sample
- As a Producer I want to be able to add samples as MIDI files to let other Users combine/continue/listen to them

## Build tool
We have been using Maven since the start of the project and you can see our pom.xml file [here](https://github.com/BudiGabe/MDS-Project/blob/main/MDSBack/pom.xml)
In our client we have been using npm to install node modules. You can see our package.json file [here](https://github.com/BudiGabe/MDS-Project/blob/main/react-test/package.json)

## Code standards + refactoring
To get closer to a MVC architecture, we moved the code inside the controllers into their respective services. You can see a refactoring pull request [here](https://github.com/BudiGabe/MDS-Project/pull/12/commits/17723ca5484d41a040bcdc9994b3dfeaad87705b)
Regarding code standards, we have been using the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Design patterns
Our backend is designed using the MVC design pattern. [Here]( https://github.com/BudiGabe/MDS-Project/tree/main/MDSBack/src/main/java/com/example/mdsback) you can see our file system, with controllers, services and models.
